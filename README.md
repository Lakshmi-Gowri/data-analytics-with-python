<br>
<h5>In this course, you will learn about python. Python is an interpreted,high-level language, general-purpose programming language. Created by guido van Rossum and released in 1991</h5><br>
<strong>Features of python</strong>
<br>
1.Multi Paradigm
  *Imperative-programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state
    ex: algol,fortram etc.,
  *Functional-treats computations as the evaluation of mathematical functions
    ex: clojure, Hashkell etc.,
  *Procedural-Languages generally use reserved words and procedures
    ex: c,java etc.,
  *Object-oriented-Languages that use real world entities called objects.
    ex: c++,java etc.,
2.open source-Free to download, developed under OSI approved license,Open for contributions
3.diversified-can be used in all categories like web development,data analysis, Machine learning, testing, big data, android app development.
4.Interpretation - statement-->statement interpretation-->operation execution-->next statement-->statement
5.easy and simple-reduce in lines of code
6.dynamic typing - static typed : variables must be declared before ex:-int a=10;
                   dynamic typed : variables are not required to declare its type ex:- a=10
7.large standard library - cntains number of libraries like pandas , numpy, tensorflow, etc.,
