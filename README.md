<strong>Features of python</strong>

<h6>Multi Paradigm</h6><br>
  *Imperative-programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state<br>

    ex: c++,java etc.,<br>
<h6>open source</h6>-Free to download, developed under OSI approved license,Open for contributions<br>
<h6>diversified</h6>-can be used in all categories like web development,data analysis, Machine learning, testing, big data, android app development.<br>
<h6>Interpretation</h6> - statement-->statement interpretation-->operation execution-->next statement-->statement<br>
<h6>easy and simple</h6>-reduce in lines of code<br>
<h6>dynamic typing</h6> - static typed : variables must be declared before ex:-int a=10;<br>
                   dynamic typed : variables are not required to declare its type ex:- a=10<br>
